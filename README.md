# Automation Exercise ‚Äì Test Automation

## üìå Introduction
This project contains an automated test suite for the [Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com) e-commerce web application.  The framework is built using **Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Page Object Model (POM)**.  
It verifies critical user workflows such as login/logout, product search, product details, cart management, checkout, and contact form.

## üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to validate the core functionalities of the Automation Exercise website, ensuring that critical user journeys such as login, product search, product detail viewing, cart management, checkout, and contact form submission work reliably and as intended. The automation suite confirms that UI elements, including product details, pricing, brand information, and cart totals, are displayed accurately, while also verifying that business rules such as login before checkout and correct cart total calculations are enforced. By executing automated regression tests with Selenium and TestNG, defects can be quickly identified and reported, delivering fast and repeatable test execution with clear reports for stakeholders.
